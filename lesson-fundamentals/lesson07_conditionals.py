# Challenge 1: Movie Admission
# Ask the user for their age. 
# If under 13, “You can watch PG or G movies.”
# If 13–17, “You can watch PG-13 movies.”
# If 18+, “You can watch any movie.”
# Example output:
# Enter your age: 15
# You can watch PG-13 movies.

# Challenge 2: Leap Year
# Rules:
#   - Years divisible by 4 are leap years...
#   - ...unless they're divisible by 100, then they're NOT leap years...
#   - ...unless they're also divisible by 400, then they ARE leap years.
# Example output:
# Enter a year: 1900
# 1900 is not a leap year.
# (Test: 2024 -> leap, 1900 -> not, 2000 -> leap)
# These are all leap years: 1600, 1692, 1996, 2000, 2004, 2020, and 2024

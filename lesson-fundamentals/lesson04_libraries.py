# Challenge 1: Circle Area with Math Library
# Use two variables "radius" and "circle_area" to calculate the area of a circle with a diameter of 14. 
# Formulas: the area of a circle is πr² -- the radius is diameter / 2

# PYTHON RANDOM LIBRARY

# Python's library is a Pseudorandom Number Generator 

# Create your own pseudorandom number generator that utilizes as seed to output a random number. 
# 1. The seed should be a INTEGER with five total digits. 
# 2. Perform oneat least 3 different math calculations on it (ie, addition, subtraction, and division). 
# Use math library to round the float UP to an integer. 
# Test if it works by changing your SEED integer value (on the left side of the decimal point)
# BONUS CHALLENGE: Make your random number always output below 10. 

# Simple version:
seed = 76743

for n in range(5):
    calcs = seed + 2234 * 22 / 3
    randint = math.ceil(calcs)
    print(f"Simple random num gen: {randint % 10}")
    seed += 1



# Change the seed, get a new, pseudorandom number

# for s in range(5):

#     step1 = seed / 6.7
#     # print(step1)
#     step2 = step1 - 800.33
#     # print(step2)
#     step3 = step2 ** 3 
#     # print(step3)
#     round_up = math.ceil(step3)  
#     result = round_up % 10 # remainder between 0 and 6 (never 6)
#     print("Your random num is:", result)

#     seed = seed * 3

# Challenge 2: Simulate a Die Roll
# Use the random library to simulate rolling a six-sided die.
# The output should be a random integer between 1 and 6.
# Store the result in a variable called "die_roll" and print it with a message.

# Challenge 3: Random Square Root
# Use random library to pick a number between 1 and 75. Store it in "num".
# Use math library to find its square root.
# Print the number, its square root, and the square root rounded UP with the math library.

# Challenge 4: Power Roll
# Roll two dice with the random library: one is the "base," one is the "exponent."
# Use math library to raise the base to the exponent. (ie, base to the POWer of exponent)
# Print both rolls and the result as an integer (hint: int() removes the .0).

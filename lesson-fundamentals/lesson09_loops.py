# LOOPS IN PYTHON
# Loops repeat a block of code until they hit a limit or condition.
# They exist to save us from typing the same line 500 times.
# Python gives us for-loops and while-loops.

import time

# The FOR-LOOP.
# A for-loop repeats for each element in a sequence (like a list or string).

animals = ["lamb", "sheep", "cow", "goose", "donkey"]

print("\nOur animals:", animals)

for a in animals:
    print("Now I'm petting a", a)
    # time.sleep(1) # pause for half a second

# We can loop a specific number of times using range().

for i in range(5): 
    print("Counting", i)

# range(start, stop, step)

for num in range(5, 105, 5):
    print(num)

# Strings are also iterable, so they can be looped as well!

# Challenge 1: Sum Calculator
# Use a for-loop to find the sum of numbers from 1 to 10.
# ie, 1 + 2 + 3 + 4 + 5 + 6 + 7 + 8 + 9 + 10
# Expected output: 55
# initialize a variable to hold the total
print()
total = 0
for i in range(1,11):
    total = total + i

print(total)

# A while-loop repeats *while* a condition is true.
# If you forget to change the condition, it loops forever.
# And then your program becomes immortal. Avoid that.

# += to add to a variable, -= to subtract to a variable, = to overright 

count = 0

    print(f"Loopin' -- We are on loop index # {count}")
    count += 1

    user_input = input("Type 'exit' to escape")

# Loop Control Statements

    if i == 9:
        pass # place holder. does nothing. will code in the future

    print("Number", i)

# Challenge 2: Guess Until Correct
# Create a while-loop that keeps asking for a number until the user types 7.
#H int: Take the user input within the loop, so it asks for a guess each time!

# Challenge 3: Use a whiteboard to predict (no running!). Write the output, then check.

# Challenge 4: Trace. Track total and n each pass. What prints?

# The first 2 passes are done for you, complete the rest:

#         total = 0 + 1 = 1

# Pass 2: check 1 < 20 → True
#         total = 1 + 3 = 4
#         n = 3 + 2 = 5
# Write out the rest of the passes, until the while loop breaks.



# Challenge 3: This code should print the number of vowels in "pineapple".
# But this code has bugs, and is in the wrong order. 
# Unscramble to count vowels in "pineapple". One line doesn't belong.
# 
#       count += 1
#     count = 0
#     print(count)
#     for letter in "pineapple":
#         if letter in "aeiou":
#             count = 1

# Challenge 4: Solve on whiteboard first Debug. 
# This loop never ends! Press Ctrl+C to stop it.
# Fix it by only changing only one small thing.

# n = 10

# Challenge 5: Write a guessing game with 5 tries and hints.
# The computer picks a secret number from 1 to 20. The player gets 5 guesses.
# The player will receive HINTS if they have an incorrect guess.
#
# preconditions: 
# the random library; 
# a random integer stored as the 'secret' that the player must guess.
#
# Pseudocode:
#   repeat 5 times (use a for-loop with range):
#       ask the player for a guess (convert it to an int!)
#       if guess equals secret → print "Got it!" and stop the loop
#       otherwise, if guess is bigger → print "Too high"
#       otherwise → print "Too low"
#   if the loop never stopped early → print "Out of guesses! It was" + secret

import random 

# Generate a random secret number between 1 and 20
secret = random.randint(1,20)

# Repeat 5 times (use a for-loop with range)

for attempt in range(5):
    # Ask the player for a guess (convert it to an int!)
    guess = int(input("Enter your guess:"))

    if guess == secret:
        print("You win!")
        break
    elif guess > secret:
        print("Too high")
    else: 
        print("Too low")

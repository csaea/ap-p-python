# Challenge 1: Favorite Quote
# Ask the user for their favorite quote and display its length.
# EXAMPLE OUTPUT:
# Enter your favorite quote: Those who believe in telekinetics, raise my hand.
# Your quote is 48 characters long.

# Challenge 2:
# Ask the user to enter a word that is at least 7 characters long. 
# Print the 2nd through 6th characters.
# Use string slicing.

# Challenge 3: Word Mutation
# Ask for a word and print it in reverse, in uppercase, and lowercase.
# Example output
# Enter a word: Python
# Uppercase: PYTHON
# Lowercase: python
# In reverse: nohtyP

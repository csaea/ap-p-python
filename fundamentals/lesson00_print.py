#KEY CONCEPTS: print statements, comments, running code.

# Write comments after a # sign. Python won't run these lines. They are for your code comments while you develop. It is typical to delete all comments before you deploy your code.

#the print command print() will display its contents in the system terminal. Typically used for debugging your program.  

print("Hello world")

#print can take in multiple arguments, separated by a comma:
print("Age: ", 4)

#it can also run expressions and methods 
print("Sum :", 4 + 5)

# CSAEA Python Fundamentals

Here you'll find all the fundamental concepts for python for CSAEA. Lessons and challenges can be found in the directories here. The lessons include everything you'd need to know for the AP Computer Science Principles Exam. 

## To Develop and Run Code

In your GitHub repository (repo), click the green button: *<> Code*. Navigate to the *Codespaces* tab, and *Create a codespace on Main*. This opens up a browser-version of VS Code. 
IMPORTANT: Codespaces are temporary, so you must always commit your code and sync it to your GitHub. 

## To Commit Your Code

1. In Codespaces (ie, VS Code), click the 'Source Control' icon on the left (it's the icon with the branches symbol, and usually a blue badge with a number on it).
2. Write a commit message. (Something very simple).
3. You can 'stage' the files you want to save by clicking the `+` symbol next to your file.
4. Click 'Commit' and then 'Sync Changes'. (If you skipped step 3, click 'Yes' or 'Always' to stage and commit your code).
5. Now your code will be saved, and appear in your GitHub repository.

## To Submit Your Work

In your GitHub repo (not Codespaces), navigate to the file you want to submit, open it, and then copy the URL link. 
Submit the link in the assignment provided to you by your teacher.

IMPORTANT: Do not copy-paste the URL to your Codespace. Codespaces are only for *you* to develop/run code in.
